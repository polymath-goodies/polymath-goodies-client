> The greatest gifts are often seen, in the course of nature, rained by celestial influences on human creatures;
and sometimes, in supernatural fashion, beauty, grace, and talent are united beyond measure in one single
person, in a manner that to whatever such an one turns his attention, his every action is so divine, that,
surpassing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing bestowed by God (as it is), and not acquired
by human art. This was seen by all mankind in Leonardo da Vinci, in whom, besides a beauty of body never
sufficiently extolled, there was an infinite grace in all his actions; and so great was his genius, and such its
growth, that to whatever difficulties he turned his mind, he solved them with ease.

The subject for this week as you might have already guessed is the eccentric, Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo was a complete misfit: an illegitimate son, gay, vegetarian and left-handed. But, his work is a sign of a creative genius, guided by sheer curiosity, audacious imagination and keen observation. Here is a short introduction video of Leonardo, the person by <em>SciShow</em>.

#### Leonardo's quotes üé®

- On understanding life
> To develop a complete mind study the science of art and study the art of science. Learn how to see, realize that everything connects to everything else.

- On maintaining a journal
> As you go about town, constantly observe, note, and consider the circumstances and behavior of men as they talk and quarrel, or laugh, or come to blows.

- On a painting method called <em>sfumato</em>
> Paint so that a smoky finish can be seen rather contours and profiles that are distinct and crude. When you paint shadows and their edges, which cannot be perceived except indistinctly, do not make them sharp or clearly defined, otherwise your work will have a wooden experience.

- Disciple of Experience
> First I shall do some experiments before I proceed further, because my intention is to consult experience first and then with reasoning show why such experience is bound to operate in such a way.

#### Other Polymath Goodies:

- I have been experimenting with Italian pop culture off late. I tried [Luciano Pavarotti](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm4xK0UUL4o_IOLKZUWGzkzUWH-isjJT8) and here's one Opera album called [Nessun Dorma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUjkgnLpWQc) which caught my attention. Nessun Dorma means "None Shall Sleep."
- Do NOT miss the Perseid Meteor Shower of 2018. The meteor shower can be seen on 12-13 August night, usually around 2 A.M (local time). Find out more at [space.com](https://www.space.com/32868-perseid-meteor-shower-guide.html)
