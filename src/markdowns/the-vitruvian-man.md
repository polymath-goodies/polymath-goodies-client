"We know very little about Leonardoâ€™s apprenticeship in Verroccioâ€™s workshop, but the short account provided by Vasari confirms that it included architectural and technological design, according to a concept that was being revived on the model of Vitruvius, as reproposed by Alberti" (Pedretti 14). Having had access to Albertiâ€™s and Vitruviusâ€™ treatises, it is no surprise that Leonardo produced his own version of the Vitruvian man in his notebooks.
